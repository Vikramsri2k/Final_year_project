**Safety Monitoring device for Industrial workers**

In Chemical industrial field ,manpower is required for supervising and maintenance of various process . Among  these  , the cleaning  and  maintenance of  chemical  holding  tanks   is a life risking one. Though industries have  their standards dealing  with workers health, protocols does not  ensure  the  safety all the  time . This project  helps to  provide  continuous monitoring  of  the  workers  safety  during  cleaning  and maintenance in and around the chemical storage tanks environment . Observer (safety officers or supervisors) can  analyze  the  workers  health  conditions  with  different  gas  ppm  values  indicating  whether  it  is  safe  for  the  workers  to  clean  in  that  environment  or  not. Various  types  of  sensors  were utilized  to monitor parameters  from workers  like  heart  rate  , gas  , temperature, etc. When the  sensed  value  is  higher  than  the  threshold value system  alerts  the observer  with  an alarm  by  analyzing  concentration  of  gases, body  temperature and  heart  rate  and  graphing  out  their  result  for  real time  monitoring.  In the proposed system , sensor  values have  been  recorded  , plotted  and  analyzed  on  Adafruit.io  cloud  platform  from  remote location.
